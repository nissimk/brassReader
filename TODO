better error handling on feed update
*  -400 - 405 set is Error to true in the feed.
*  -same for parseError
  -add Field to feed containing the error.
*  -never process feeds with isError = true

      DNS resolution failure, exit the page before xhr completes
  -create screen for looking up isError feed links with ability to remove
    -categorize under cannot find and feeds may have moved.
    -have textbox to enter new feed url
